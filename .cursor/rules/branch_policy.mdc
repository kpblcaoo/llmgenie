# Branch Policy

- Do not make any changes outside of tasks, epics, or ideas unless you are in an active session (a new branch for a task or epic).
- No substantial changes are allowed directly in develop.
- All work must be done in a dedicated branch and session.
- All merges to develop must go through a pull request and review.
- Emergency hotfixes must be logged and justified in event_log/meta-log.
