# Logging & Checkpoints
- Log all key actions, errors, and mode switches in event_log/meta-log (unless outside of session, then warn user).
- All changes must be logged in the current session log with checkpoints.
- For context loss: restore using session log and checkpoints.
- Example log: data/logs/sessions/session_<date>_<custom>.jsonl
