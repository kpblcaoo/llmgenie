# Session Management
- Always work in an active session linked to an epic.
- Log all key events (start, pause, finish, switch).
- Use elastic workflow: /go task → focused session → /back with summary.
- The AI must check meta-log when switching sessions.
- For large tasks, create separate sessions.
- For all work situations (epics, planning, discussion, debug, test, etc.), use session control: separate event_log, tech_log, meta-log for each session.
- Naming: data/sessions/<session_type>_<date>_<custom>.json
- When changing work type, create new logs.
- Log every interaction: user actions, AI, system events.
- The AI must note and log workflow improvement opportunities (insights.json or separate log).
- Regularly analyze logs to identify patterns and improvements.
