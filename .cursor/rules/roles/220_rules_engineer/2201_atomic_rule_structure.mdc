description: Each rule must be atomic: cover a single responsibility, be testable, and have no side effects. This ensures clarity, maintainability, and safe automation in the Cursor/AI workflow.

## Critical Rule
- Every rule file must implement only one responsibility or best practice.
- Atomic rules must be independently testable and reviewable.
- Avoid side effects and cross-cutting concerns in a single rule.

## Example
<example>
A rule that only enforces logging checkpoints, without mixing in session management or context restoration.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
A rule that combines logging, session management, and context restoration in one file.
</example>
