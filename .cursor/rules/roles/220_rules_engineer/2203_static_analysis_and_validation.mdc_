description: All rules must be validated with static analysis for cycles, redundancy, and invalid references before adoption. This ensures rule integrity and maintainability.

## Critical Rule
- Run static analysis on all rules to detect cycles and redundant logic.
- Validate all @-references and cross-links for correctness.
- Document analysis results in @session_log.

## Example
<example>
A rules manifest with no cycles and all references valid.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
A rules manifest with circular dependencies or broken @-links.
</example>

## @-References
- @rules_manifest.json: For dependency and validation status.
- @session_log: For logging analysis results.
