description: Rules must be designed for multi-environment portability (Cursor, VSCode, CLI, API). Use configuration files to map generic references to environment-specific implementations.

## Critical Rule
- Ensure all rules are portable across supported environments.
- Use configuration files for environment-specific mapping.
- Document environment compatibility in @rules_manifest.json.

## Example
<example>
A rule that works in both Cursor and CLI, with config mapping for file paths.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
A rule that only works in Cursor and fails in VSCode or CLI.
</example>
