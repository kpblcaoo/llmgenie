# Branch Policy (Atomic)
- Do not make any changes outside of tasks, epics, or ideas unless you are in an active session (a new branch for a task or epic).
- No substantial changes are allowed directly in develop.
- All work must be done in a dedicated branch and session.
- All merges to develop must go through a pull request and review.
- Emergency hotfixes must be logged and justified in event_log/meta-log.

## @-References
- @session_log: For logging emergency hotfixes and justifications.
- @workflow_enforcement: For enforcement of branch policy in all modes.

## Fallback
- If session_log unavailable, log to local file and notify rules_engineer.
