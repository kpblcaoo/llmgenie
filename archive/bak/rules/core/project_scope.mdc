# Symlink Usage Policy

- Symlinks (.cursorrules, prompts_collection.json, .cursor, data) are used only for local development convenience between llmstruct and llmgenie.
- Symlinks must be listed in .gitignore and are not tracked by git.
- All official dependencies between projects must be declared in requirements/pyproject, not via symlinks.
- For production, CI/CD, and external users, use pip install and do not rely on symlinks.
- All project data (tasks, ideas, projects, etc.) must be stored in data/ (symlink to ../llmgenie/data).
- All workflow objects (tasks, epics, logs) must include a "project" field for multi-project support.
- All ideas, insights, and plans must be recorded in data/tasks.json, data/ideas.json, data/insights.json with unique id, project, author, assignee, created, and updated fields.
- Dates (created, updated) should be generated automatically or updated on each change. For legacy data, update to current date if relevant.
- Regularly review and archive old project data (data/archived_jsons/).
- Document all best practices in .cursor/rules/ and docs/ for onboarding and reproducibility.
