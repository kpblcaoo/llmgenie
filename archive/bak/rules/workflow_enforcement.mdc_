description: USE ALWAYS in [meta], [code], [debug] modes to enforce workflow discipline and session logging
globs:
alwaysApply: true

- At session start: check ai_workflow.json
- Before any work: start session log
- In [meta], [code], [debug] modes: log all actions in event_log/tech_log/meta-log
- Never delete files without explicit user permission
- After rule change: restart chat (Command-N)
- If session log not started, prompt user to create one

# Tag-to-role mapping: see workflow_roles_matrix.mdc_

# USE WHEN: entering any of these modes or switching between them.
