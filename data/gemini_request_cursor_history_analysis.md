# Request for Gemini 2.5 Flash: Cursor History Intelligence Analysis

## 🎯 **Mission: Revolutionary Workflow Intelligence Mining**

You are tasked with analyzing Cursor IDE history data to extract **workflow intelligence patterns** for building a predictive AI assistance system. This is part of **Phase 4A.4** of an advanced MCP-enhanced development environment.

## 🔄 **INCREMENTAL PROCESSING STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Data Structuring & Initial Dump**
1. **Parse Raw History Data** into standardized format
2. **Create Structured Files:** JSON/JSONL with metadata + content
3. **First Data Dump:** Save structured data to files
4. **PAUSE & TRANSFER** → Hand structured data to Claude for review

### **Phase 2: Incremental Pattern Analysis**
1. **Batch Processing:** Work on chunks to avoid context overload
2. **Pattern Extraction:** Process each data type incrementally  
3. **Regular Data Dumps:** Save analysis results after each batch
4. **PAUSE & TRANSFER** → Hand analysis findings to Claude

### **Phase 3: Final Intelligence Synthesis**
1. **Consolidate Insights** from all analysis batches
2. **Create Implementation Roadmap** with priorities
3. **FINAL TRANSFER** → Complete handoff to Claude for architecture design

### **Benefits of This Approach:**
- ✅ **No Context Overload** - work in manageable chunks
- ✅ **Structured Handoffs** - clean data transfer points  
- ✅ **Incremental Progress** - build insights layer by layer
- ✅ **Quality Control** - review at each checkpoint

### **Checkpoint File Format:**
```json
{
  "phase": "1|2|3", 
  "status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-05T...",
  "files_created": ["list of new files"],
  "data_summary": {
    "total_sessions_analyzed": 0,
    "patterns_identified": 0,
    "key_insights": ["high-level findings"]
  },
  "next_steps": "what Claude should do next",
  "context_transfer": "essential context for continuing work"
}
```

## 📋 **Your Task**

### **Primary Objective:**
Analyze the Cursor IDE history files and extract:
1. **AI reasoning patterns** - how different models approach problems
2. **User interaction patterns** - feedback, corrections, preferences  
3. **Workflow optimization insights** - what works, what doesn't
4. **Error correction strategies** - how problems get diagnosed and fixed
5. **Decision-making processes** - architectural and implementation choices

### **Data Location:**
```bash
# Cursor history structure (171 sessions available)
~/.config/Cursor/User/History/<hash_id>/
├── entries.json    # Metadata
└── *.md           # Content files with AI dialogs

# Large content files (>5KB) for priority analysis:
/home/kpblc/.config/Cursor/User/History/5447fc8/uqhx.md
