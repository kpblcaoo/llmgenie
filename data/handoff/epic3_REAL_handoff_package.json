  "startup_prompt": "[review] Resuming Epic 3: Standards and automation of atomic rules, handoff and context transfer. Status: automation phase completed with full handoff validation system. Infrastructure: FastAPI endpoints (POST /handoff/validate, GET /handoff/template), CLI tool (handoff_cli.py), atomic rules updated including 016_context_transfer_protocol. Lessons: structured validation critical for handoff quality, testing real workflow more important than infrastructure alone. Constraints: must maintain .mdc_ work protocol, complete documentation before rule finalization. Next: validate real-world usage, integrate with CI/CD, complete documentation phase.",

    "What is current Epic 3 status and what automation components have been implemented?",
