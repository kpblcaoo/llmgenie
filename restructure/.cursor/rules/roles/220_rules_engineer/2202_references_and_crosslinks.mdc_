## Critical Rule
- Every rule must include an @-References section listing all related files, rules, and documentation.
- Cross-links should be updated when dependencies change.
- Use @rules_manifest.json to track all references and cross-links.

## Example
<example>
A rule with an @-References section listing @session_log and @ai_workflow.json.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
A rule with no @-References section, or missing links to related files.
</example>

## @-References
- @rules_manifest.json: For manifest and dependency tables.
- @docs/decision_memos/: For rationale and decision history.
